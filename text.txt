The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm amber glow across the quiet landscape. A gentle breeze stirred the leaves, and the distant hum of evening life began to rise. In that tranquil moment, time seemed to pause, offering a brief escape from the chaos of the day. It was a reminder that even in the busiest lives, there is beauty in stillness.
Everything felt like it was moving too fast. Notifications, deadlines, the constant hum of noise — it never stopped. But for just a minute, she paused. She looked out the window, watching the city lights flicker like static on an old TV. It didn’t solve anything, but in that moment, it felt like breathing again.
In the quiet town of Elmsworth, the clock tower struck thirteen. Nobody noticed, except a curious crow perched atop the weather vane. Beneath its watchful gaze, a faded map lay forgotten in the attic of the old Holloway house, its edges curled like the pages of an unwritten story. Rain tapped gently on the windows, whispering secrets only the wind could understand.
